# 🖼️ Image Captioning using Transformers

This project demonstrates **image captioning**, where a model generates descriptive captions for images using **Transformer-based architectures**.  
It combines **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to understand image content and generate meaningful textual descriptions.

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Import Libraries** – Load essential libraries for deep learning and NLP.
2. **Dataset Loading** – Import images and corresponding captions.
3. **Preprocessing**  
   - Image resizing and normalization.
   - Text cleaning and tokenization.
4. **Feature Extraction** – Use a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet, InceptionV3) to extract image features.
5. **Model Architecture**
   - Encoder: CNN for image feature extraction.
   - Decoder: Transformer model for sequence generation.
6. **Training** – Train the model on the dataset.
7. **Evaluation** – Assess model performance using BLEU scores and qualitative results.
8. **Caption Generation** – Generate captions for new images.

## 📈 Results
- The model successfully generates meaningful captions for unseen images.
- Demonstrates the power of **transformers and attention mechanisms** in bridging vision and language.

Example:
| **Input Image** | **Generated Caption** |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| 🐶 (Dog Image) | "A brown dog is playing in the park." |
